# Diagnosis of mental load from ECG signals.

* Performed data preprocessing using pandas to to convert the filtered signal data into samples of 15 seconds each.
* Implemented a Fully Connected Neural Network using PyTorch.
* Currently performing hyperparameter tuning to improve the accuracy on the test data.
